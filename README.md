# Garage Pi

This is a pretty basic hack but I intend it to go further. Right now only supports garage door opener on one relay, but I'd like to build it to be extensible -- supply a configuration object with the things you'd like to control and then run the thing. I built it for a Lightning Talk at a (Rockford Web Devs meetup)[http://rockdevs.com]. Eventually it'll control my lights (interior and exterior), TV (mostly used for sound) and music (via the simple API (Kodi)[http://kodi.wiki/view/JSON-RPC_API/v6] provides. It may even get it's own spot on the wall eventually...

Like I said... it's a hack.
